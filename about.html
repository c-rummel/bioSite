                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Sarah is a passionate person who loves her job, family, and traveling with both.
                     Originally from Atlanta, she now lives in the central Florida area working at 
                     <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/" target="_blank">Walt Disney World</a>. She has said many times that her favorite thing in the world is 
                     reading, but those who know her best would argue that her real favorite thing is 
                     working. She is very goal-oriented and loves to find a sense of accomplishment in 
                     anything she does.</p>

                <p>When Sarah does take time for herself, she will often read period fantasy novels, 
                    and she loves to travel. Most often, she visits cities that have a rich history to 
                    them, domestically and abroad. She said, “my grandma always told me that we would 
                    go to Paris together. We were never able to, but I was finally able to go on my 
                    honeymoon. I loved the art, the architecture, and just being in a place where so 
                    many historical moments have happened.”</p>

                <p>Cities are not the only places that call to Sarah. She also loves the outdoors. 
                    Spending time hiking, bicycling, and running round out the list of favorite activities. 
                    Most recently, she spent a week in the mountains of northern Georgia doing just those 
                    things. “I love being outside,” she said. “Especially when the weather is nice, it makes 
                    everything better. Walks are better, coffee tastes better, reading is better. I would 
                    love to move someplace more temperate so that spending time outside is easier to do year-round.”</p>
